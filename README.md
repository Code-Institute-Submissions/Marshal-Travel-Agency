# Features

## Existing Features
* The Index page offers four nav bars which uses internal hyperlinks page jump to take users to relevant sections.
It contains full-width responsive Hero Image Heading Caption with a call-to-action button and a popup design.
The call-to-action button takes user straight to booking section while the popup design additionally showcase the website appealing benefits.

* The services section features transparent Jumbotron with a brief text informing users about services.
After the brief text description, a Grid system with inner card elements presents different services.
Each of the eye-catching pictures has a button which takes user directly to contact section for more information as related to services.

* The Booking section contains togglable tab which utilizes JavaScript to click on the specified tab button.
Each tab houses relevant forms and button in tandem to the subject matter.
The Flight and hotel button specifically contains popover which makes use of JavaScript to inform users about discount.
The Flight and Hotel search Tab renders data with Dynamic API (Amadeus Content-based) while Flight+Hotel and Car makes use of Static API: it can be dynamically generated
but it is statically delivered.

* The Contact section contains contact form with EmailJS Integration for submission.
The contact form has a validating pop up modal assuring users upon submission of their enquires or request.

* When users get at the button of a long page, they often need to get back to the top.
There is a Back to Top button integration with JavaScript to allow users to quickly navigate to the top of the page.

## Features Left to Implement
* I will like to add more data for different locations.

* A Virtual Reality should be added for users. 
This will allow travelers to test out experiences before they book a trip. Guests can preview hotel rooms, attractions and experiences 
as if theyâ€™re really there. It helps guests ensure they are spending their time and money wisely and planning the trip of their dreams.

# Testing

During the development process of this project, I intend to use Rapid API, but because I couldn't secure authentication key from Skyscanner
I adopted Amadeus self service APIs. The Amadeus API I used for this site has only return flights. It wasn't an easy integration for me, I had to rigorously follow some examples both written and youtube videos
now and then checking that all the API calls returned responses as expected.
The flight and Hotel search is returning live data and responses in real-time with the use of 3-letter IATA Codes for Cities and Airport as inputs.
This was further simplify by creating a dropdown options with the IATA codes well defined for good user experience.

Amadeus doesn't have endpoints for flight+Hotel jointly and car hire service, so I made use of a mock API server for flight+Hotel and Car search
which returns dummy data. It generates data dynamically but the responses are static with no realistic result in this case, it doesn't perform any
action other than delivering content(static JSON files) to the requesting user.

## Speed Test

Website was tested on [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) and [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com) platforms.

![speed-test](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Travel-Agency/assets/images/speed-test.png)

The Initial speed performance test generated a poor loading analysis which necessitated the use of Tinypng to shrink the image size to 67%.

Tinypng utilises smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of PNG and JPG files. This shrunk the image size to 67%.
the site uses less bandwith and load faster.

## EmailJS Test

Integration of the EmailJS was very easy because I followed the well implemented course in code institute module.
methods may vary as integration evolves but the end result was achieved as seen below:

## EmailJS Sent

## EmailJS Received

## Further Testing

* All links were tested. Internal links all work. External links all work and open in new window.
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was test run on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhoneXR, Samsung Note3, Samsung Tab2 & Nokia.
* The site was test run by friends and colleagues for possible user experience issues and bugs.
* All the pages are responsive on all screen sizes.
* All the API calls returned responses as expected.
* The call to action buttons links as expected and the modal form pops up with all the input components validated.
* Each Search button generates feedback data on a new page which has a back to homepage link.
* The Email and Phone number at each footer "contact details" are clickable for users.
* All Codes were validated through the Markup Validator to erase syntax error.

## Bugs
* The fetch data from local storage scripts was merged initially to their respective js files but it was generating the below error on the console: 

## Console error
![console-error](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Travel-Agency/assets/images/console-error.png)

This was rectify by linking the script to the bottom of the body element at each page since I can't have a "for loop" run after redirecting to a new page
(accessing dom fail because it is redirecting). 

* The "Book Now" button and "Click here for details" link tend to overlap on some mobile devices when held in landscape mode.
